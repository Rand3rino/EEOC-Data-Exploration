# EEOC-Data-Exploration
A Shiny App to assist in data exploration for an EEOC dataset. This is also my semester project for STA 631.

The app can be found here, https://rand3rino.shinyapps.io/EEOC-Data-Exploration/.

There is a general year filter and then two sets of filters for the populations that the user wants to compare.
